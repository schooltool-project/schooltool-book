The SchoolTool Book
===================

This is the source tree for the SchoolTool documentation.  The docs are written in ReStructured Text, which is the standard markup for Python documentation, and managed using Sphinx, which handles turning the markup into HTML, PDF, etc.

To download this source, you'll need the bzr version control system.  On Ubuntu, you need to do::

    sudo apt-get install bzr

Then, to fetch the source::

    bzr branch lp:~schooltool-owners/schooltool/users-guide

To grab the rest of the Python dependencies and put them in a nice sandbox away from your system Python, ``cd`` into the ``users-guide/`` directory and do::

    python bootstrap.py

The ReStructured Text source files are under ``source/``.  To generate HTML, from the ``users-guide/`` directory do::

    make html

The files will appear under ``build/html/``.

That should be enough to get you started.
