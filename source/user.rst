Creating a User Account
=======================

If you are also a teacher in the school, you should not use the "manager" account for your day-to-day SchoolTool tasks, such as grading and taking attendance.  You need to make a second account for yourself in the role of a teacher.  Logged in as "manager," click on the **School** link at the top of the page, then **People** to end up here:

Under **Add** in the sidebar, you have shortcuts for some common groups -- **Administrator, Student, and Teacher** -- and just **Person** lets you choose a different primary group, or no group for the person.  We'll just use the basic **Add: Person** form this time:

Most of the fields are optional except for the fields with green asterixes **first name**, **last name**, and **username**.  For now, just put in your basic information and a password.  We'll go into much more detail concerning the rest of this form later.

Click **Submit** and you should see:

You should now be able to **Log Out** as "manager" by following the link at the upper right, and **Log In** as your new user, at which point you should see the user's calendar:
