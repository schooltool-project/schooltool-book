Creating a User Account
=======================

You should not use the "manager" account for your day-to-day SchoolTool tasks, 
such as grading and taking attendance.  You need to make a second account for 
yourself in the role of a teacher.  Logged in as "manager," click on the 
**Manage** link at the top of the page, then **Persons** to end up here:

Click the **New Person** action button, then fill out the subsequent form:

Most of the fields are optional and probably not immediately relevant to your 
personal use of SchoolTool, except for **first name**, **last name**, 
**username** and **password**.  

**Group** isn't essential at this point, but you can select "Teachers."

Click **Add** and you should see:

You should now be able to **Log Out** as "manager" by following the link at 
the right end of the red bar and **Log In** as your new user, at which point 
you should see the user's calendar:
