Creating a User Account
=======================

If you are also a teacher in the school, you should not use the "manager" account for your day-to-day SchoolTool tasks, such as grading and taking attendance.  You need to make a second account for yourself in the role of a teacher.  Logged in as "manager," click on the **Manage** link at the top of the page, then **Persons** to end up here:

Click the **New Person** action button, then fill out the subsequent form:

Most of the fields are optional except for the fields with red asterixes **first name**, **last name**, **username** and **password**.  For now, just put in your basic information.

**Group** allows you to add a person directly to "students" or "teachers."

Click **Add** and you should see:

You should now be able to **Log Out** as "manager" by following the link at the right end of the red bar and **Log In** as your new user, at which point you should see the user's calendar:
