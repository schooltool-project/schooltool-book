Adding Skills to Projects
-------------------------

A teacher gradebook with no skills assigned to the course will look like this:

   .. image:: images/cando-projects-1.png
   
This includes an empty default project called "Project1".  We will rename this to "Hands-On."  Click on **Settings: Projects** in the left sidebar:

   .. image:: images/cando-projects-2.png

And on the yellow edit pencil next to **Project1**:

   .. image:: images/cando-projects-3.png

Click **Submit**:

And **Done** to return to the gradebook:

To add a Skill to the current project, click **Add: Skill** in the left sidebar.  Use the form to search for the skill you would like to add.  You can use the checkboxes to select specific layers in the skills hierarchy.

Clicking on the title of the Skill, Skill Set or other node will take you to a form displaying a Skill Set or list of Skill Sets.

In this case, you see the Basic Geometry Skill Set, with the trigonometry skill pre-selected.  You could also add other Skills from this set at this time if you wished.  

Click **Submit**:
