Setting Up People
=================

Making Your Teacher Account
---------------------------

You should create a teacher account to do your actual grading.  Logged in as "manager," click on the **Manage** link at the top of the page, then **Persons** to end up here:

Click the **New Person** action button, then fill out the subsequent form:

Most of the fields are optional and probably not immediately relevant to your personal use of SchoolTool, except for **first name**, **last name**, **username** and **password**.  

**Group** isn't essential at this point, but you can select "Teachers."

Click **Add** and you should see:

You should now be able to **Log Out** as "manager" by following the link at the right end of the red bar and **Log In** as your new user, at which point you should see the user's calendar:

Adding Your Students
--------------------

You can manually add your students one at a time using the same procedure as above, adding each student to the "Students" **Group**. 

Note that since SchoolTool will only be accessible from your computer, and the students will not be logging onto SchoolTool themselves, you **do not** need to give students **Passwords**, and you can use whatever you want for their **Usernames**.

Do not feel obligated to add contact or demographic information unless doing so is useful to you.
