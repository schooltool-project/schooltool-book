Setting Up People
=================

Making Your Teacher Account
---------------------------

You should not use the "manager" account for your day-to-day SchoolTool tasks, such as grading and taking attendance.  You need to make a second account for yourself in the role of a teacher.  Logged in as "manager," click on the **Manage** link at the top of the page, then **Persons** to end up here:

Click the **New Person** action button, then fill out the subsequent form:

Most of the fields are optional and probably not immediately relevant to your personal use of SchoolTool, except for **first name**, **last name**, **username** and **password**.  

**Group** isn't essential at this point, but you can select "Teachers."

Click **Add** and you should see:

You should now be able to **Log Out** as "manager" by following the link at the right end of the red bar and **Log In** as your new user, at which point you should see the user's calendar:

Adding Your Students
--------------------

You can manually add your students one at a time using the same procedure as above, adding each student to the "Students" **Group**. 

Note that since SchoolTool will only be accessible from your computer, and the students will not be logging onto SchoolTool themselves, you **do not** need to give students **Passwords**, and you can use whatever you want for their **Usernames**.

Do not feel obligated to add contact or demographic information unless doing so is useful to you.

There are alternate methods of adding multiple students at one time.  We will cover two below.  Note that these methods do not currently allow you to automatically add demographic data, just the username, first and last names, and password for each person.

Logged in as "manager," click on the **Manage** link at the top of the page, then **Persons** and finally click the "Import Persons" button:
