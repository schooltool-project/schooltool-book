Contacts
========

Since SchoolTool's main use is in primary and secondary schools, the primary out-of-school contact is with parents, guardians and other adults responsible for the child.  

SchoolTool currently lacks an explicit method for adding contact information for the student him or herself, nor does it allow you to define the type of relationship between person and contact.  These features will be added a future releases.

Each person can be linked to one or more contacts, for example a parent, step-parent or other guardian, and each contact can be linked to one or more people in SchoolTool, so siblings can both reference the same parent contact.

Contacts can currently only be managed through the web interface.

Creating and managing contacts
------------------------------

Usually you will create a contact in reference to a person.  So, as "manager," go to **Manage** and **Persons**, and select a person:

Then click the **Contacts** button:

This form presents a list of contacts for the person (there are none to start) and lets you add a new contact or search for and link an existing contact.

To start we'll **Create a new contact**:

After you hit **Add** you return to the person view, hit **Contacts** again:

Now you can see the contact we created under **Assigned Contacts**.  Click on the last name to view or edit the contact information.

To demonstrate linking to an existing contact, we'll add the same contact to Charlie Brown's sister, Sally.  Navigate back to **Manage**, **Persons**, click on **Sally Brown** and **Contacts**.  You can search by first and/or last name for existing contacts in the system.  By default, this form will search for available contacts with the same last name as the person, so "Charles Brown," the contact we just created has already been found.

Check the contact or contacts you'd like to add to the person, then press **Assign**.  When you're done, **OK** will return you to the main view for the person.

To view, edit or add to all the contacts in the system, you can go to **Manage** and **Contacts**.
