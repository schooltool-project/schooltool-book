Contacts
========

In the case of primary and secondary students -- the main focus for SchoolTool -- the most important out-of-school contact is with parents, guardians, and other adults responsible for the child.  SchoolTool's Contact system is designed with this case in mind.  You can also attach a full or partial set of contact information directly to a person in SchoolTool, for example, to store full contact information for a teacher or adult student, or to add an email address for a student.

Each Person can be linked to one or more Contacts (for example, a parent, step-parent, or other guardian) and each Contact can be linked to one or more People in SchoolTool, so siblings can both reference the same parent Contact.

Creating and managing Contacts
------------------------------

Usually you will create a Contact in reference to a Person.  To do so, you must be logged in as a member of **Clerks**.  Go to the **School** tab, click on **People**, select a Person, and click on the **Contacts** header, under **General Information**:

In the **Contacts** section, click the **Manage Contacts** link:

This form presents a list of Contacts for the Person. At first, there are no Contacts in the list. You may add a new Contact, or search for and link to an existing Contact.  

Click on **Add: New Contact** in the sidebar.  If we wanted to add contact information for Sally herself (if we wanted to contact her directly, rather than her parents), we'd select **Add: Sally Brown as Contact**.

This form should be straightforward:

Your new Contact:

Click on the Contact name:

And in the student's slider:

To add an existing contact to Sally's record, for example her brother Charlie, we could search for him under **Available Contacts**:

Click the green (+) to add him as a contact for Sally:

Click on Charlie Brown's name, and then the edit pencil next to **Contact Information** to set their relationship to "Sibling":
