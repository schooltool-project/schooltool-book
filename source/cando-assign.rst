Assigning Skills in CanDo
=========================

There are several methods of assigning skills to courses and sections.  

Batch Assignment
----------------

Batch assignment is preferable if you have a large body of standards that are applied in a predictable manner to specific courses.  

First we'll make a Course in SchoolTool called "Building to Teach."  See :ref:`courses` if necessary:

We want this to map to the correspondng "Course" created in CanDo:

Note that the "Course" layer in CanDo is one we created when making the skill document in the previous example.  Your layers may have different names; any layer can be associated with a SchoolTool Course.

Note that both the Alternate ID for the Building to Teach Course is "B2T Hands-On Math," which matches the title of the skills "Course."

Return to the SchoolTool **Course** index (via the **School** tab), and you will see a **Batch Assign Skills** link:

As mentioned above, we have set up the example so that the Course Alternate ID matches the title of our Course node's Title, so we select the following in the form:

   .. image:: images/cando-assign-4.png

And click **Search**:

This looks through all the Courses in the school for matching "Course" nodes in the skills.  Since we have only set this up for the Building to Teach course (not Art, English, etc), only one course is matched.  Click **Assign**:

This returns us to the course index.  If we click on the **Building to Teach** link, and then **Skills** we will see the assigned skills:
