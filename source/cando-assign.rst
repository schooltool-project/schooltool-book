Assigning Skills to Courses in CanDo
====================================

There are several methods of assigning skills to courses and sections.  

Batch Assignment
----------------

Batch assignment is preferable if you have a large body of standards that are applied in a predictable manner to specific courses.  This method is a bit abstract, but it is successfully used to assign thousands of skills to hundreds of courses.

First we'll make a Course in SchoolTool called "Building to Teach."  See :ref:`courses` if necessary:

We want this to map to the correspondng Cluster created in CanDo:

Your layers may have different names (other than "Cluster"); any layer can be associated with a SchoolTool Course.

Note that both the Alternate ID for the Building to Teach Course is "B2T Hands-On Math," which matches the title of the skills Cluster.

Return to the SchoolTool **Courses** index (via the **School** tab), and you will see a **Batch Assign Skills** link:

As mentioned above, we have set up the example so that the Course **Alternate ID** matches the title of our Cluster **Title**, so we select the following in the form:

   .. image:: images/cando-assign-4.png

And click **Search**:

This looks through all the Courses in the school for matching "Course" nodes in the skills.  Click **Assign**:

This returns us to the course index.  If we click on the **Hands-On Math** link, and then **Skills** we will see the assigned skills:
