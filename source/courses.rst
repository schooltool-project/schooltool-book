Setting Up Courses

Creating Courses
----------------

In SchoolTool, there is a distinction between "courses" and "sections."  A "course" describes what is taught -- the curriculum.  A section is an actual group of students being taught this content.  For example, "1st Grade Mathematics," "British Literature," and "Algebra II" are all courses.  "9:30 Algebra II, Spring 2008" or "Period B Algebra II, 2009 - 2010" are sections.

Where one teacher teaches all subjects to a single group of kids, for example, in a kindergarten, you can either make everything one course ("Kindergarten") or split it up ("Kindergarten Math," etc.).  Whichever makes more sense for you.  Things like "homeroom" or "advisory" or "internship" that are scheduled at a specific time but don't have a set academic curriculum or grades are also considered courses.

You can't create sections without courses, so any use of SchoolTool that requires students and teachers to be assigned to sections requires courses.  For larger or more complicated schools, importing courses from a spreadsheet will save some time.

Courses are organized by year, so that they can be updated from year to year without overwriting previous courses or changed descriptions.

To create courses, logged in as "manager," click the active school year and then **Courses**:

Then, click the **New Course** button and fill out the form.  A title is required; a description is optional:

After you click **Add**, you should see your new course:

Repeat until you've got all your courses entered.
