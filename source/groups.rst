Groups
======

In SchoolTool groups are used to model some default roles in a school as well as allowing a wide variety of custom groups to be created to suit local needs.

The default roles as defined by the **Clerks, School Administrators, Site Managers, Students,** and **Teachers** groups affect the permissions access privileges of their members.  See :ref:`security` for further explanation.

Groups are stored by year.  That is, each school year has its own set of groups.  For example, you have "Students" for year "2008-2009" and a separate "Students" group for "2009-2010."

Groups can be managed through the web, imported via CSV or by :ref:`spreadsheet`.

Adding People to Existing Groups
--------------------------------

In :ref:`persons`, we imported some people via CSV who have not been assigned to groups.  We're going to add all of them to the "Students" group.

Since they are stored by year, the first step in managing groups is to click as "manager" on the link to the relevant year at the top of the page.
