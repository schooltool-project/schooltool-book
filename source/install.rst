Installing SchoolTool on Ubuntu
===============================

For the forseeable future we are only supporting deployment on `Ubuntu Linux <http://ubuntu.com>`_ (currently, the Gutsy and Hardy releases).

#. Add SchoolTool's Launchpad PPA to your Software Sources.

   Either manually edit ``/etc/apt/sources.list``, or go to the **System** menu, select **Software Sources** and select the **Third-Party Software** tab.

   Add these lines:

   If you're running gutsy::

    deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/schooltool-owners/ubuntu gutsy main
    deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/schooltool-owners/ubuntu gutsy main

   If you're running hardy::

    deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/schooltool-owners/ubuntu hardy main
    deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/schooltool-owners/ubuntu hardy main
    
   .. image:: images/sources.png

#. Update your software list.

   Either type ``sudo apt-get update`` in a Terminal or, if you've got the Synaptic package manager installed, go to **System > Administration > Synaptic Package Manager**, launch it, and click **Reload**.

#. Install schooltool-2008.

   Either type ``sudo apt-get install schooltool-2008`` in a terminal (and answer "y" to the subsequent questions), or in Synaptic search for "schooltool-2008", select it for installation, and hit **Apply**.

   If all goes well, many, many small Zope components will be installed and you'll have a SchoolTool server running on http://localhost:7080.  If that doesn't work, try http://127.0.0.1
   
   **The login is "manager" and the default password is "schooltool".**
