Gradebook, Attendance and Report Cards
======================================

Schools around the world use many types of grading and assessment, and it is unlikely that any one gradebook could suit everyone's needs and desires.  SchoolTool is designed to be modular and allow customized gradebooks for specific needs.  One example of this is the CanDo competency tracking gradebook, which is not currently included in the standard distribution of SchoolTool.

These tutorials cover the standard gradebook, attendance journal and report card functionality that are provided with the standard SchoolTool packages.
