Setting Up Courses and Sections
===============================

Creating Courses
----------------

In SchoolTool, there is a distinction between "courses" and "sections."  A "course" describes what is taught -- the curriculum.  A section is an actual group of students being taught this content.  For example, "1st Grade Mathematics," "British Literature," and "Algebra II" are all courses.  "9:30 Algebra II, Spring 2008" or "Period B Algebra II, 2009 - 2010" are sections.

Where one teacher teaches all subjects to a single group of kids, for example, in a kindergarten, you can either make everything one course ("Kindergarten") or split it up ("Kindergarten Math," etc.).  Whichever makes more sense for you.  Things like "homeroom" or "advisory" or "internship" that are scheduled at a specific time but don't have a set academic curriculum or grades are also considered courses.

The course setup is significant when a whole school is using SchoolTool.  For an individual, the most important thing is to keep it simple and functional.

To create courses, logged in as "manager," click the active school year (below it is **2008-2009**) and then **Courses**:

Then, click the **New Course** button and fill out the form.  All you really need is a title, but you can also add a short description and course identifier:

After you click **Add**, you should see your new course:

Repeat until you've got all your courses entered.

Creating Your Sections
----------------------

 To add sections of a course, first click on the course name in the course index (**English 9** in the example above):

Click on the **New Section** button to create a section:

Change the name of the section to something that will distinguish it from your other sections.  For example, if I teach four sections of English 9, "9:30 English" is more meaningful than "English 9 (1)."  Click on the **edit info** link to change the name.

Click **edit instructors** and make yourself the instructor of this section:

Note that you need to click **Add** to register the change prior to clicking **OK**:

Click **edit individuals** and use the same procedure to add students to the section.
