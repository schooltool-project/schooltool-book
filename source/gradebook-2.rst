Managing Multiple Activities, Categories, Worksheets
====================================================

Multiple Activities
-------------------

Now we will make a second activity:

If you want to fill-down the same score for all students (admittedly, you generally wouldn't do this for an exam, but for homework, for example) enter a score in the top row marked **Apply a grade for all students** and then click the white **Apply** button:

   .. image:: images/gradebook-11.png

As you can see, after you **Update** the changes, the **Total** and **Average** columns are also updated.

If you want to change the order of the columns, click **Manage Activities** and use the drop down number menus to re-order the activities.

If you want to make other changes to the activities, click on their titles on this page.  Click **Return to Gradebook** when you are done.  The re-ordered columns:

Weighting Categories
--------------------

The most straightforward way of maintaining a point-based gradebook, like SchoolTool's, is to assign the number of points according to the importance of the assignment.  For example, a weekly quiz might be worth 10 points and a major exam worth 100.  If you do it this way, you don't have to weight categories.

On the other hand, if you want to score all types of assignments the same -- say you want to assign percentage scores to both weekly quizzes and major exams -- then you may need to weight by category.  For example, quizzes are worth 25% of the grade and exams worth 75%.  If weighting categories doesn't make sense to you, you probably don't need to weight categories.

If you don't need or want to weight categories, you can skip the rest of this section.

Categories are weighted *by worksheet*.  So this must be defined on each worksheet.

While viewing the relevant worksheet, click **Weight Categories**.  Simply enter the weight of each category by typing numbers in the available fields.  The sum of the weights must total 100.

So in the above case, exams are 75% of the calculated average, quizzes are 25%.  Hit **Update** and the scores will reflect the new weights:

Multiple Worksheets
-------------------

You can create multiple worksheets to organize your work in various ways.  One straightforward use is if the section is defined by a semester which is divided into two grading quarters, each quarter might be assigned its own worksheet.

To add a worksheet, click **Worksheets** from the gradebook view:

   .. image:: images/gradebook-17.png

First we'll change the name of the default "Sheet1."  Click on the **Sheet1** link and the **Edit**:

   .. image:: images/gradebook-18.png

We'll switch it to something more descriptive:

   .. image:: images/gradebook-19.png

And hit **Apply**:

   .. image:: images/gradebook-20.png

Now we'll add a second worksheet.  Hit **New Worksheet** and give the new worksheet a title:

   .. image:: images/gradebook-21.png

Hit **Add**, and then **Return to Gradebook**.  Now you've got two tabs:

   .. image:: images/gradebook-22.png

We'll click on the Second Quarter tab and add a new activity as we did above:

   .. image:: images/gradebook-23.png

The **Summary** link takes you to an overview of the averages from each worksheet for the section:
