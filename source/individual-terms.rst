Creating Terms
--------------

Terms are periods of time which define the school year.  The term implementation is currently very simple.  There is no hierarchy of terms, for example school years which contain semesters which contain marking periods.  

For the current implementation, simply define terms which correspond to the duration of a section.  For example, if you work with the same group of students on the same schedule for a full year, define one term as a year.  If you switch schedules and/or student groupings at the end of semesters or trimesters, define those as your terms.

In this example, we will create two semesters.

As "manager," click **Manage** and then **Terms**:

Press the **New Term** button, and enter a name for the term and the start and end dates.  You can click on the **...** button to bring up a calendar selector:

When you've got the start and end dates, click **Next**.

You will now see a calendar view which allows you to toggle specific days and dates on and off by clicking on them.  If a date is black means classes are in session; dates in red mean no classes.  Any day that student attendance will be taken should be in black.  A teacher training day with no classes would be red.  

For example, I've added Christmas vacation the weeks of December 23rd and 30th:

When you are satisfied with this, select **Add Term**:

If you need to edit the term, click on its title and select **Edit**.
