Developers' Handbook
====================

This section of the book contains information relevant to programmers interested in developing or extending SchoolTool.  In particular, it is the only section that assumes you are using a development sandbox build of SchoolTool, rather than a precompiled binary release from the `Ubuntu Linux <http://ubuntu.com>`_ software package repositories.
