Using the Gradebook
===================

SchoolTool's standard gradebook allows teachers to track point scores for assigned activities.  That is, the teacher creates activities, assigns a numeric point range for the activity, and then assigns each student a score for that activity.  Activities can also be assigned to categories, which can be weighted for the purpose of calculating an overall average.
