Entering Attendance and Scores in the Journal
=============================================

With our new Score Systems for attendance and scoring set in the Journal, log back in as a teacher and navigate to the Journal.

Each tab represents a month in the term selected at left.  Each column is a meeting of the section selected at left.  This is affected by the **Treat consecutive periods as one meeting** setting in :ref:`sections`.

Entering Attendance Data
------------------------

Note that **Help: Score System** will bring up a reminder of valid codes.

Click in the cell corresponding to the student/period in question and enter a code.  If it is valid, the cell background will turn green and the full value and description should appear below the cell.  If there are multiple valid scores starting with this letter, all valid choices will appear as a menu below.  

If you click outside the cell, or click the value in the menu, the score will be entered in the cell.  If you press the **Enter** key, the score will be entered and the cursor will move down to the next cell in the column.  If you press the **Tab** key the value will be entered and the cursor will move right to the next cell in the row.

All entered values are unsaved until the **Save** button is pressed.  Cells with the green background are unsaved.

The **Absences** column totals the student's absences for the entire Term (not just the current month).  For example, viewing the **October** tab carries across the **September** statistics from above.

The **Average** column provides the average of the numeric scores for the term.  Note that if no score is entered for a given day, it is not included in the calculation.  That is, an empty cell does not equal "0" when the average is calculated.
