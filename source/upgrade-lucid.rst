Upgrading SchoolTool
====================

After `SchoolTool 1.4 <1.4-release-notes.html>`_, released for Ubuntu 10.4,
"Lucid Lynx," new stable point versions of SchoolTool will be released only for
the new/current version of Ubuntu.  For example, `SchoolTool 1.5
<1.5-release-notes.html>`_ will be available only for Ubuntu 10.10, "Maverick
Meerkat."  

An exception to this is SchoolTool 2.0, for which packages will be released to our Launchpad PPA.

Security updates and necessary maintenance releases will continue to be made for
earlier supported SchoolTool versions.

The main implication of this change is that as long as you do not upgrade the
version of your operating system, you will not unexpectedly install a new
version of SchoolTool that includes new features, changes in the user interface,
or anything else that might confuse current users.  This will also limit the
introduction of new bugs to production servers.

This change *does* mean that to upgrade SchoolTool you will have to upgrade the
entire system you're running SchoolTool on.  It is another good reason to run
SchoolTool on its own dedicated server or virtual server, so that you do not
have to upgrade other services at the same time if you don't want to.

See `Upgrade instructions for Ubuntu <https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/installing-upgrading.html>`_
for more info on upgrading your system (and thus SchoolTool).


Upgrading from Ubuntu 8.04 LTS (Hardy) to 10.04 LTS (Lucid)
-----------------------------------------------------------

Before the dist-upgrade (distribution upgrade) from Hardy to Lucid all
third-party repositories are disabled, therefore SchoolTool is not upgraded at
the same time. Some Zope libraries in Hardy conflict with python (<< 2.6), so
they are removed on dist-upgrade, and in turn SchoolTool is removed as well and
is not running for the duration of the upgrade. To avoid that, it is possible to
upgrade those libraries so that SchoolTool is not removed.

Edit ``/etc/apt/sources.list`` and change schooltool-owners line from "hardy" to
"jaunty". Then upgrade several Zope-related packages::

    sudo apt-get install python-paste python-zodb python-zope.app.component python-zope.app.container python-zope.hookable python-zope.i18nmessageid python-zope.interface python-zope.proxy python-zope.security python-zope.ucol

You can then `upgrade Ubuntu <https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/C/installing-upgrading.html>`_
normally.

After the upgrade is complete, edit ``/etc/apt/sources.list`` and change
schooltool-owners line to "lucid". Then ``sudo apt-get update`` and ``sudo
apt-get upgrade`` again to get the newest Schooltool and Zope libraries.
