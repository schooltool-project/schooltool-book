System Requirements
===================

For production deployment,

For personal use, SchoolTool can be installed and used on a personal desktop or laptop computer, accessing the web interface locally.  This type of installation is not going to be under heavy load, since there is only one user, but it will eat up some memory while running in the background.  In most cases you would want over 512 MB for such an installation.
