Reports
-------

In SchoolTool, "Reports" are processes which generate a result, which is
generally a downloadable file such as a PDF or XLS spreadsheet. It is possible
for a Report to generate an HTML result which would be viewed in the browser,
but this is rare. Generally, a Report result is something you download.

**School Administrators** and **Clerks** should have permissions to generate Reports
for any Students in the system. **Teachers** should have access to the relevant
data needed to generate Reports for any Students in their Sections.

Reports are mostly contextual (you go to the Student to generate their report 
card, rather than vice versa)

Report overview tells you what reports can be run on your system.
If you add reports (how?) they show up here.
