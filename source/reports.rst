Understanding Reports
=====================

Using Reports
-------------

In SchoolTool, "Reports" are processes which usually generate a downloadable 
file such as a PDF or XLS spreadsheet (the "result).  There is report
which returns a chart on a web page.

Report Overview
---------------

The Report overview tells you what reports can be run on your system.  This
list is updated when reports are added or removed from your system by updates
or new packages.

Navigate to the Report Overview by clicking the **School** tab and then
selecting **Reports: Overview** in the left sidebar.

The Report Overview displays a table listing the Category, Title, File Type and
Description of all Reports on the system.

The Category indicates the scope of the Report, which may be a range of people
(an individual **Person** or a **Group**, a **Student**, a **Section**, or the
entire **School**), a span of time (**Term** or **School Year**), or a
**Resource** report.

The Category indicates where you can find each report.  Reports are mostly 
contextual.  For example, to print the report card for a student, you 
navigate to the student, then select the report card under **Reports**.  
In some cases, you also have to navigate to a specific component.  For example, 
to generate a Journal Attendance Export, you must navigate to the section's
journal.

The File Type indicates the type of file returned as a Report result, which may
be a printable PDF, an XLS spreadsheet, or a ZIP archive.

Some reports can be run over individual people, groups or sections.  

Adding Custom Reports
---------------------

Reports are added through packages. It's possible for a developer to design and
add custom reports for your organization, but this is outside the scope of this
page.

:ref:`report-sheet` are customizable by **School Administrators** and **Clerks**
through the SchoolTool user interface.

Generating Reports
------------------

**School Administrators** and **Clerks** should have permissions to generate Reports
for any Students in the system.

**Teachers** should have permission to run any reports directly relevant to 
their sections.
