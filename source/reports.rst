Reports
-------

PDF, XLS, CSV exports are considered "Reports" (things you download)

Or: Reports are processes that generate PDF, XLS, or CSV exports.
    Running a Report returns a result -- a downloadable file.

To generate Reports, you must be logged in as a member of:
Clerks?
Site Managers?
School Administrators?
Teachers?
Students?

Most people who install SchoolTool to "kick the tires" will begin by logging on to the system as the Default Manager, so I'm looking atÂ http://schooltool3:7080/persons/manager where "Reports" show up at the bottom of the left-hand sidebar: "ID Card", "Profile", "Student Detail Report", "Student Report Card", "Course Worksheets Report", "Transcript".

However, most of these Reports are meaningless in this context, since they attempt to generate, e.g., a Student Report Card for the Default Manager. This is confusing. I find myself wishing that for clerk, manager, and administrator Roles there was a Report Input Dialog which would allow you to select the context or scope of the report from here.

Reports are mostly contextual (you go to the student to generate their report card, rather than vice versa)

Report overview tells you what reports can be run on your system.
If you add reports (how?) they show up here.
