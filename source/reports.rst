Reports
-------

PDF, XLS, CSV exports are considered "Reports" (things you download)

Or: Reports are processes that generate PDF, XLS, or CSV exports.
    Running a Report returns a result -- a downloadable file.

Reports are mostly contextual (you go to the student to generate their report card, rather than vice versa)

Report overview tells you what reports can be run on your system.
If you add reports (how?) they show up here.
