Reports
-------

In SchoolTool, "Reports" are processes which generate a result, such as a PDF 
or XLS spreadsheet. Generally, a Report result is a downloadable file.

A few Reports simply return a webpage, but this is rare.

Report Overview
---------------

The Report overview tells you what reports can be run on your system.

Navigate to the Report Overview by clicking the **School** tab and then
selecting **Reports: Overview** in the left sidebar.

If you add reports, they show up here.

Reports are added through packages. It's possible for a developer to design and
add custom reports for your organization, but this is acccomplished through
Python programming rather than the SchoolTool user interface.

:ref:`report-sheet` are customizable by **School Adminatrators** and **Clerks**
through the SchoolTool user interface.

**School Administrators** and **Clerks** should have permissions to generate Reports
for any Students in the system.

**Teachers** should have access to the relevant data needed to generate Reports 
for any Students in their Sections.

Reports are mostly contextual (you go to the Student to generate their report 
card, rather than vice versa)
