Setting Up Sections

Creating Your Sections
----------------------

 To add sections of a course, first click on the course name in the course index (**English 9** in the example above):

Click on the **New Section** button to create a section:

Change the name of the section to something that will distinguish it from your other sections.  For example, if I teach four sections of English 9, "9:30 English" is more meaningful than "English 9 (1)."  Click on the **edit info** link to change the name.

Click **edit instructors** and make yourself the instructor of this section:

Note that you need to click **Add** to register the change prior to clicking **OK**:

Click **edit individuals** and use the same procedure to add students to the section.
