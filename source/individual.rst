SchoolTool for an Individual Teacher
====================================

SchoolTool is primarily designed as a server application to be used by a whole school.  However, it can be easily installed on a laptop or desktop pc running `Ubuntu Linux <http://ubuntu.com>`_ and used by a single teacher.  With light load -- one user -- performance should be fine on reasonably modern equipment, but your milage may vary.  In particular, this provides a way to test SchoolTool before introducing it schoolwide.
