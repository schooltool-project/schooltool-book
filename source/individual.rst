SchoolTool for an Individual Teacher
====================================

SchoolTool is primarily designed as a server application to be used by a whole school.  However, it can be easily installed on a laptop or desktop pc running Ubuntu Linux and used by a single teacher.  With light load -- one user -- performance should be fine on reasonably modern equipment, but your milage may vary.  In particular, this provides a way to test SchoolTool before introducing it schoolwide.

Installation
------------

The first step is :ref:`install`.  The good news is that this is no more difficult than installing a regular desktop application.  The bad news is that it is only this easy on Ubuntu.
