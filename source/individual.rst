SchoolTool for an Individual Teacher
====================================

SchoolTool is primarily designed as a server application to be used by a whole school.  However, it can be easily installed on a laptop or desktop pc running `Ubuntu Linux <http://ubuntu.com>`_ and used by a single teacher.  With light load -- one user -- performance should be fine on reasonably modern equipment, but your milage may vary.  In particular, this provides a way to test SchoolTool before introducing it schoolwide.

All this documentation is relevant to setting up SchoolTool for multiple users.  One of the biggest differences is that a school-wide installation will hopefully use more mass data imports to streamline the process of setting up hundreds of accounts, whereas an individual teacher can easily do most of the setup simply entering data into web forms.
