Viewing your Terms and Timetables in the Calendar
=================================================

Once you have your terms and timetables set up, you should be able to view the results in your calendar.  Specifically, the days when school is in session should display the start times of class periods.  

Click on **Calendar** at the top of the page.  If the day you're viewing is not part of a term, that is, a day school is not in session, you will just see a basic hourly grid:

To see when school is in session, click on the **Yearly** link above the calendar table:

If there is a term defined in the current calendar year, the days between the beginning and end of the term should be highlighted:

If the term is in a different year, use the **Previous year** or **Current year** links to navigate to it.
