SchoolTool 2.5 Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Long-running tasks
==================

Some tasks take more than a few seconds to complete, especially in bigger
schools. Users were not able to use the application while reports were being
generated. Downloads were timing out in as little as 10 seconds. Such tasks
should be done asynchronously to allow users do something else, or wait for them
to be completed if they wish so.

`Celery` is an asynchronous task queue that executes long running tasks.
SchoolTool and its plugins now use it to do the following tasks in background:

- PDF reports
- XLS export
- XLS import (disabled)
- Multiple reports in a ZIP archive 

Messages are sent when a task is completed. They are available from the Home
page. A notification with the number of new messages is displayed near the
person's name in the top right of the page.


Server
======

There are now 4 processes, controlled by a ``supervisor`` daemon:

  + `schooltool`    - schooltool web application
  + `zeo` - ``ZEO`` server allows many clients to use the same ``ZODB`` storage
  + `celery_report` - a ``celery`` task queue that generates reports
  + `redis`         - a simple key-value database for ``celery``

New ``make`` targets:

  + start       - start all processes as daemons
  + stop        - stop all processes
  + restart     - restart `schooltool` and `celery` processes
  + rerun       - stop `schooltool` and run again in the foreground. restarts `celery`
  + status      - status of all processes

`Redis` server is written in C and needs to be installed separately. On Ubuntu
or Debian::

    $ sudo apt-get install redis-server

Instances have to be updated to run this version. If you run from a sandbox::

    $ bin/make-schooltool-instance instance

Ubuntu package ``schooltool`` contains updated configuration files. If they have
been modified, you may be asked how to handle the conflicts. So it is
recommended to upgrade it in the terminal::

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install schooltool


Ubuntu
======

SchoolTool 2.5 is available for

- 13.10 (saucy) from the universe_
- 13.04 (raring) from the dev_ PPA

Additionally, there are daily builds from ``trunk`` branches of actively developed
projects in the trunk_ PPA.

students.  Individual questions can be tagged with skills in CanDo to
automatically update a student's skill rating in the gradebook based on quiz
results.
