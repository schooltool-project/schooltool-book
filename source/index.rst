The SchoolTool Book
===================

SchoolTool is free administrative software for schools around the world. The goals of the project are to create a simple turnkey student information system, including demographics, gradebook, attendance, calendaring and reporting for primary and secondary schools, as well as a framework for building customized applications and configurations for individual schools or states.

SchoolTool is built on a 100% open source software stack, written in `Python <http://python.org>`_ using the `Zope 3 <http://zope.org/>`_ framework.
